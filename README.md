#  **HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor**

This is the completed first week challenge for the UPENN LPS Coding bootcamp.  The project required us to take an existing index.html file with a corresping style.css and to refactor the code in both files so that they follow best practices and meet accessibility standards.  

# **Motivation**

The motivation in completing this challenge was multifaceted, in using the "learning by doing" model of this program I was able to encounter new concepts, as well as explore, and expand my growing knowledge of html and css. This included but was not limited to:
- Learning about and become better acquainted with accessibility standards for things like screen readers.
    - using alt attributes for images.
- Impletmenting best practices in using semantic HTML element.
    - Making sure those elements follow a logical structure.
    - Making sure all links function properly.
- Using proper commentary for both HTML and css.
- Learning to fork, clone, pull, and push using the command line and [Github](http://github.com).
- Learning how to publish a finished project to a live URL using Github Pages.
- Learning the importance of README.md 
    - successfully using markdown to present a clear and well formatted README.
