#  **HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor**

This is the completed first week challenge for the UPENN LPS Coding bootcamp.  The project required us to take an existing index.html file with a corresping style.css and to refactor the code in both files so that they follow best practices and meet accessibility standards.  

# **Motivation**

The motivation in completing this challenge was multifaceted, in using the /"learning by doing"/ model I was able to learn/, explore/, and expand my growing knowledge of html and css this included:
*  Learn about and become better acquainted with accessibility standards for things like screen readers.
  *  use alt attributes for images.
*  Impletment best practices in using semantic HTML element.
  *  Make sure those elements follow a logical structure.
  *  Make sure all links function properly
*  

###  but this will be an h3 heading while the one above should be h2

It works!  *but what happens* if we try to __combine a bunch of different__ elements into the same line including a [link](http://www.google.com)
